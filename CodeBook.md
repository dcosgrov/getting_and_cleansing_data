Study Design - How data was collected and transformed

For this analysis, data was gathered from the following URL which is associated with an experiment related to wearable computing:

For in-depth information regarding the wearable computing study, please see:

Contained within the zip file referenced above, are several training and test datasets that were used as data sources.  Specifically, the following 6 files serve as direct input into the run_analysis.R script that is capable of producing an output file called sumary_data.out:

X_train.txt: core training dataset 
y_train.txt:  activity codes that correspond with the records contained in X_train.txt
subject_train.txt: subject codes that correspond with the records contained in X_train.txt
X_test.txt   core test dataset
y_test.txt   activity codes that correspond with the records contained in X_test.txt
subject_test.txt  subject codes that correspond with the records contained in X_test.txt

The summary_data.out file that is generated contains aggregate average calculations for every distinct activity/subject combination associated with the wearable computing experiment referenced above.  Specifically, the summary_data.out file that is generated by run_analysis.R only contains aggregate averages for those columns in the X_train.txt and X_test.txt input files that contain the terms “mean()” or “std()” since only mean and standard deviations aggregations were required by the client requesting the aforementioned aggregate data and these column substrings are consistent with what the study explicitly referenced as mean or standard deviation related variables. 

The steps that follow outline the overall flow of data transformations that occur within the run_analysis.R script that is capable of generating summarized output:

Read in training data/records from the 3 files identified above containing the term “train” within their filenames.
The source activity codes within the y_train.txt file referenced above were transformed into user-facing, English names such as “WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS”, etc…
Read in test data/records from the 3 files identified above containing the term “test” within their filenames.
The source activity codes within the y_test.txt file referenced above were transformed into user-facing, English names such as “WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS”, etc…
The specific mean and standard deviation column numbers contained within the core training and test data sets were identified by using grep commands against the features.txt file delivered by the study that captures the variable names and associated ordinal positions within the core training and test data sets.  Specifically, 2 grep commands were issued:
grep -i “mean()” features.txt > means.txt
grep -i “std()” features.txt > stddev.txt
Next, the means.txt and stddev.txt files created in the previous steps were appended together to build an overall list of mean and standard deviation columns and their associated ordinal positions within the core training and test data sets.  The files were appended by simply using the following command:
cat means.txt stddev.txt > means_and_stddevs.txt
The column numbers identified in the previous step were then used to subsequently subset the core test and training data read into memory by the run_analysis.R script.
After filtering out columns unrelated to standard deviation and mean columns, each core test and training data tables were combined with their corresponding activity and subject data tables using the cbind() in the script to create combined, complete training and test data tables.
Next, the the combined, complete training and test data tables were simply merged together into an overall data set using the rbind() R function.
After combining into an overall data table, tidy names assigned to the data table to replace the more cryptic source names.
Next, this combined data table was transformed using ddply to generate a new, summary data table that contains averages for each mean and standard deviation calculation captured from previously.  The averages for the mean and standard deviation columns were specifically calculated for each unique activity/subject combination reflected in the data.
After aggregating the data, new tidy column names were given to the table to reflect the aggregate/summary nature of the values calculated.
Lastly, the data associated with this summary table is output to a file called summary_data.out in the current working directory.

Below is a an inventory of variables/column names within the dataset that is captured in the summary_data.out file generated by run_analysis.R.  Note that each variable has a comment “prefixed by #” that indicates its corresponding source information.  For the features listed below, keep in mind that the source variables referenced reflect the raw data variables within the X_train.txt and X_test.txt source files.
